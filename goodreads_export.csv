And he read the audiobook version himself and he sounds exactly the same, it was such a treat to listen to.<br/><br/>I highly recommend pairing this book with This Changes Everything by Naomi Klein, I read them back to back and the contrasts are valuable. Bill Nye is a tech geek and I could so relate to a lot of what he got excited about, but having just read Klein's book I found his absolute faith in technical solutions to be a tad overly optimistic and his never mentioning the racist roots of which areas get saddled with the most environmental degradation to be a big miss. Like many engineers he focuses entirely on the technical problem and ignores the equally interesting complex problem of the social forces that are shaping how we value things. Different books and different authors are going to have different specialities though, which is why I most recommend the two books together. I think that Klein was perhaps too dismissive of our technical solutions and too untrusting of the ability of engineers to empathize and build smart things that actually won't make the world a worse place.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed hearing Nye's perspectives on the many bad and a few good ideas about big technical possibilities for how to help our warming planet.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

When she talked about the pressure of having to ""speak for all women"" with every little thing she did I could relate. That pressure is real and it sucks. I'm glad that she is out there being herself and I hope that more of the world will warm up to the idea that women can come is just as many diverse packages as men, and that a woman doing her thing is not trying to redefine what women are, she is just trying to be herself.<br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Compared to people living in hand built shelters trying to launch a rocket I really couldn't decide between relief and jealously.<br/><br/>What I hoped to get out of the book was some insight into what it takes to make a business with an environmental or human focus. Musk's stated personal purpose is to help move the human race to a multi-planetary species, and to remove our dependence on fossil fuels. Two things that I fully support (though would emphasize in the opposite order).<br/><br/>What I really got was a lot of amusing (sometimes tiresome) hero worship of Musk, interspersed with interesting company history, and a few great quotes. I grow weary of the ""he's a jerk but he gets results"" persona in tech culture, but at the same time I did come away from the book with an appreciation for many of Musk's perspectives. As a former physicist I can appreciate his approach to solving problems from first principals, but as an empathetic human being I think he (and the tech culture at large) need to expand what we care about to include social issues that are harder to quantify and derive.<br/><br/>Fun quotes:<br/>""If the rules are such that you can't make progress then you have to fight the rules.""<br/>""I don't think we're doing a good job as a society deciding what things are really important to do""<br/>""The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads.

The importance of setting boundaries with our technology, not letting it become a distraction machine, giving our real life relationships precedent, are all things I completely agree with and I enjoyed seeing someones else's take on explaining why. <br/><br/>Rushkoff's thoughts also included historical details that I had not considered from previous tech revolutions (language, written word, printing press, broadcast media). The idea that the masses have always ended up at the mercy of an elite few: ""...while Renaissance kings maintained their monopoly over the printing presses by force, today's elite is depending on little more than our own disinterest."" Rushkoff thinks the few who will have undue sway now are the technologists and so it behooves everyone to learn something of programming. <br/><br/>What I didn't agree with was an argument he made about how being a programmer makes it easier to see how the systems of the world exist and influence each other. I know plenty of people who can't code that are extremely well versed in complex systems and plenty of programmers who still don't understand systemic racism.<br/><br/>Fun quotes:<br/> * Like the participants of media revolutions before our own, we have embraced the new technologies and literacies of our age without actually learning how they work and work on us.<br/> * Digital reduction yields maps. These maps are great for charting a course, but they are not capable of providing the journey. No matter how detailed or interactive the map gets, it cannot replace the territory.<br/> * We learn to socialize and make friends through interfaces and networks that may be more dedicated to finding a valid advertising model than helping us find one another.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Suppose that he is running a small business with 5 employees and each person there has 15 dependents that they are providing for. This means that the net business is the livelihood of 90 people. Meanwhile in the USA it gets big in the news that people in Africa are dying from Malaria so some US celebrity decides to donate money for the construction of 100,000 malaria nets and send them to Africa. These nets are given for free, they flood the market and the small net business is now bankrupt. The 90 people are in a worse state than before. Additionally when the 100k nets inevitably wear out (average net life is 5 years) there will be no business that can replace them. The village is more dependent than ever on aid and if no celebrity comes forward with more nets in 5 years they will be sicker as well.<br/><br/>This is one of the problems with Aid. People give without seeing the whole picture and all too often Africans are represented by white western celebrities. A better way forward would have been for someone to offer to buy the nets from the African business making them and distribute them within the country for free, support and develop the local economy instead of snuffing it out.<br/><br/>Sometimes my eyes glazed over a bit at the paragraphs of dollar values (and this from someone who studied math and physics) but it was necessary. If you start the book and find those sections tiresome just keep going, I promise it is worth it.",,,,,,0,,,,,
