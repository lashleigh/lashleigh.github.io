What is your dream?
 * To spend basically all of my time reading. Well, not just reading. I wouldn't want to read just any old thing. I want to spend all of my time learning and sharing what I've learned with others.


What are your obstacles?
 * I don't see how I could make money doing this
 * I'm not a very good writer
 * I don't want to become a traveling speaker or author

I really like giving talks, I like performing, but somehow I also feel bad about it. I feel like it isn't a "serious" enough skill to spend a lot of time on. It feels like there is something _better_ I should be doing. But that is probably bullshit. I'm comfortable in front of a crowd - something that most people are not - and I've pretty much always gotten over whelmingly positive feedback. So... What's the hangup? Am I worried that I don't have enough to talk about? Not really, there will always be something more. I love learning things and then sharing those things with other people, that is my passion. I also love performing, I wouldn't have danced for all those years if it wasn't something I enjoyed, and the theater too. But at a certain age it starts to feel like one ought only to do things one is a professional at. 

I have this judgey person who lives in my head that pushes me to better myself and in turn tells me to try and convince others to better themselves as well. But I know people well enough to stay away from a direct approach, just shouting "Hey! Read more books, consume less sugar, and go for a long walk." doesn't really make a person very many friends. My life is a constant struggle of somehow keeping friends while also being this neurotic person who wants to "improve" everyone around me. But what is an improvement really? What does it mean to improve? To be better?

That question is how it all started, maybe if I could understand what it really means to improve then I could have the right way to convince people that what I was saying made sense. Or maybe I'd discover that improvement was a myth and by seeing behind the curtain this curse of judgement would be lifted and I would be free. Or maybe something totally unexpected would happen.

* Story about Chris and Devin, both saying that if they're going to read they feel like it should be something that betters them, and then that just doesn't sound fun. They don't want to read for fun. If you aren't reading for fun, you probably aren't getting "bettered".

That conversation and others like it made me start to wonder: What are the things that make us better? I really love the online creation brainpickings, the creator of the site Maria Popova is something of a role model to me. About a year ago I was thinking about my career wish that someday I could just learn things for a living (which of course I was disabused of, more about that later) and while thinking of it figured why not google that and see if someone succeeded. I don't know the exact phrase I searched but brainpickings was the top hit. I was fascinated, in love, and desperately jealous. Becuase she had made the thing that I wanted to make. and because it existed, and in a form far superior to what I would ever accomplish my life was basically over. Except of course it wasn't, I got over myself, and I read a bit more, and discovered that she'd been working on her site for 10 years. I was so curious if there were other people like her and I google that something like "websites similar to brainpickings" and I ended up on quora then on another blog looking at someones top 25 internet things. And right there at #25 they'd put brainpickings and in the comment thread was a conversation about how this person *loved* brainpickings but also found it to be a huge time suck and so something to be cautious of, because after all, they want to make sure their time is spent "improving" themselves.

How odd, I thought, that these people wouldn't see time on brainpickings as being equally enriching to time on these other sites. But the other sites taught practical things. Like how to get more visitors to your website. Perhaps to improve is to have a metric that one can improve against, I've certainly thought this way in the past. Measuring is tricky business though, having the wrong yardstick can lead to some truly unfortunate outcomes.

I think we really have to talk as a society about what it means to improve and what it is we are working towards. 

I want to change people -> and that doesn't seem like a good thing -> so I should stay home
I want to get on a stage and inspire people -> but that seems selfish and manipulative -> so I should stay home 
I want to better myself -> but the only way I know to do that is by reading books -> so I should stay home
All flow charts lead to staying home. Interesting.
