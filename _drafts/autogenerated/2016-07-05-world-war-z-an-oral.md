Just not for me. I made it 90 minutes in to the 6 hour audiobook. There are many reason why I eventually decided that I wanted to do something else with the remaining 4.5 hours, mostly captured by the other 1 star reviews. There was one thing that I didn't see other people mention though: after being introduced via interview to at least a half dozen characters and by proxy to a dozen more there is not a single non-male character of significance. I like a little more diversity in my cast.
