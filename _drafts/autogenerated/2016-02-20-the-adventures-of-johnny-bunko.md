Highly recommended for the visual learners out there, much of the content from Pink's "Drive" condensed into one delightful comic book style story that takes ~30 minutes to read.

I'm really not sure what to rate this book, it is really creative and I could easily see it being a 5 to some people. It is short and simple, and that is part of the genius, Pink has taken something with a huge amount of research behind it and made it easy for people to read. That said, I prefer digging into the research, this is almost too short and too easy.
