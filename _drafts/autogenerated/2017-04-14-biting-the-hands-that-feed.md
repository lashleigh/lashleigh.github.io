Well researched and easy to read. I didn't agree with all of the authors conclusions, but I appreciated the way that he presented them - as in "here are some ideas and suggestions", rather than "here is the absolute solution and anything else is stupid".

Highly recommend to people who are interested in knowing more about the food system and how we can go about getting fresh healthy food for all people in the country.
