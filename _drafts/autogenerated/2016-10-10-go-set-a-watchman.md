Not sure how I felt about this one. I think I only finished it because it was an audiobook and I didn't have anything else to do on a long bus ride. Maybe it is objectively a good book, but I thought it was kind of awkward, all of the characters I had loved in the previous one had mutated into less interesting versions of themselves.
