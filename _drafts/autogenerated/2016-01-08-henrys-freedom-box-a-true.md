One of my friends shared a list of "Honest books about slavery young people should actually read", I was saddened that not a single one of them was familiar to me and set out to correct that. This one was especially powerful and is a book I plan to make sure all of my young nieces and nephews get exposed to. I think there are many people in the world who can't even conceive of how messed up and cruel slave trade really is, and it is only by facing that reality in our past that we can ensure people work against it going forward.

My standard public education was a total joke when it came to race, there was so much I learned from children's books this year that was never mentioned in the official history texts. But it is a long time since I was out of school, and the statue of limitations for blaming my schooling has worn out, from now I will embrace the responsibility of educating myself on the histories of marginalized people.
