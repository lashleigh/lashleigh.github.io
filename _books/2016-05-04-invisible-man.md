Books like this are in a class all their own that make ratings seem irrelevant. I listened to the audiobook and the narration was perfect, highly recommended.

The whole story is mesmerizing and at parts heart breaking, confusing, funny or weird. The thing that I'll never forget was the funeral speech and its haunting familiarity from words said about the shooting of Mike Brown and other black youth. If you want to understand America I think this is required reading.
