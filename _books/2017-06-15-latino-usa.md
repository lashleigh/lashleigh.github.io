The non-fiction graphic novel (or is that an oxymoron?) 

There are themes coming up here that I've been seeing all over the place
 * Disney is not so innocent (No Logo and the story about Mulan to get back into Chine)
 * The problematic WTO and the free trade agreements are not remotely new problems, the US has always been this way. It's right there in Manifest Destiny, the expansionist, consumptionist behavior goes back to the very beginning.
 * The xenophobic backlash we are experiencing in the wake of a black presedincy w/Trump is nothing new either. The story goes that an old woman went into a post office in Texas and couldn't find an Egnlish speaking teller
 * Police discrimination was rampant
 * The discriminated against propagating further discrimination (a clergyman writing to request black slaves to replace the natives)
