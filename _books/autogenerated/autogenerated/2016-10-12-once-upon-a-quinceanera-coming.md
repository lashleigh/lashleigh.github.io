This book was so many things; historical and autobiographical. I thought it was beautifully done. Some reviewers seemed disappointed that Alvarez tried to cover so much ground in one volume, but I thought it added depth and really enjoyed getting a sense of the person behind the research. We are all biased and by showing more of who she was I felt Alvarez was inviting us to understand her own biases.

Side note I listened to this as an audiobook and it had great narration.
