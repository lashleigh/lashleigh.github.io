This is a high 3 - the star rating system is failing me here a bit. I did like this book, and I would recommend it - especially to those short on time. Pink does a great job making his case that autonomy, mastery and purpose are what drive us forward and we need to create environments that foster it. I just think the books Pink himself included inside Drive on what he called "the essential reading list" are, well, more essential.
