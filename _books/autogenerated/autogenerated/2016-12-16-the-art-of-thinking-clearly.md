This book is a giant listicle. One hundred interesting or noteworthy mental traps that people fall into. I had the audiobook version and listened to it while riding the bus, it was ok, but I seriously doubt I would have read the book if the audiobook wasn't an option. I was already familiar with most of the stories he told and I feel that other authors had covered them better and with less arrogance. If you are interested in this kind of content I'd highly recommend checking out "Thinking, Fast and Slow" instead.
