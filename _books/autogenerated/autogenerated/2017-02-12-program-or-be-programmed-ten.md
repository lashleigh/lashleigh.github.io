The points that Rushkoff makes here about technology resonated with my own observations of how tech has impacted me and the people around me. The importance of setting boundaries with our technology, not letting it become a distraction machine, giving our real life relationships precedent, are all things I completely agree with and I enjoyed seeing someones else's take on explaining why. 

Rushkoff's thoughts also included historical details that I had not considered from previous tech revolutions (language, written word, printing press, broadcast media). The idea that the masses have always ended up at the mercy of an elite few: "...while Renaissance kings maintained their monopoly over the printing presses by force, today's elite is depending on little more than our own disinterest." Rushkoff thinks the few who will have undue sway now are the technologists and so it behooves everyone to learn something of programming. 

What I didn't agree with was an argument he made about how being a programmer makes it easier to see how the systems of the world exist and influence each other. I know plenty of people who can't code that are extremely well versed in complex systems and plenty of programmers who still don't understand systemic racism.

Fun quotes:
 * Like the participants of media revolutions before our own, we have embraced the new technologies and literacies of our age without actually learning how they work and work on us.
 * Digital reduction yields maps. These maps are great for charting a course, but they are not capable of providing the journey. No matter how detailed or interactive the map gets, it cannot replace the territory.
 * We learn to socialize and make friends through interfaces and networks that may be more dedicated to finding a valid advertising model than helping us find one another.
