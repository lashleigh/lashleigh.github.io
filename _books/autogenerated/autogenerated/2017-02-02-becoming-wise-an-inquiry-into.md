I listened to the audiobook version, Krista Tippet read it herself and included original excerpts with the people she interviewed.

If I had know exactly how much religion and spirituality was in this book I probably wouldn't have picked it up, and I definitely would have missed out. I am horrified by things done in the name of religion, but not so naive as to think that religion hasn't also been at times an incredibly positive part of our collective history. I want the world to outgrow the kinds of faith that people use to harm others, but to retain the positive aspects of faith based teachings. I don't want the militant atheist world, one that so often discounts everything about how people feel and the possibility that what people believe actually matters.

Fun quotes:
 * I've come to think of virtues and rituals as spiritual technologies
 * Our cultural mode of debating issues by way of competing certainties
 * Dogmatic atheism is no more intellectually credible than dogmatic faith. Both presume a certainty in things unproven.
 * Longing is engineered. What if we actually were content with our lives? What if we actually knew this was paradise? It would be very hard to control us.
