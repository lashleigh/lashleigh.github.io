A book about food was perfect for Thanksgiving break! I grew up on a farm and was back home visiting and talking about the future of agriculture when I started reading. This book is a lovely meditation on the trials and tribulations for the small(ish) farming families, I have a whole new appreciation for the peaches and raisins that I enjoy.

I learned about this book from reading The Third Plate where the Masumoto peach makes an appearance.
