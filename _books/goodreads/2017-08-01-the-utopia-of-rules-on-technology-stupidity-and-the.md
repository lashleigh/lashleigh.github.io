I enjoy David Graber for the same reason I enjoy many good writer's, they point out things I've been living with but hadn't really noticed before. Prime example below, also I highly recommend his phenomenal essay on comic book superheros, it was included at the end of this book or can be found online <a href="http://dedicto.com/wordpress1/dde/2012/10/28/batman-constituent-power/">here</a>.


<blockquote>
Consider the ATM. In the last thirty years, I can't remember a single occasion in which I have asked an ATM for money and gotten an incorrect amount. Nor have I been able to find anyone I know who can. This is so true that in the wake of the 2000 U.S. presidential elections, when the public was being regaled with statistics on the 2.8 percent degree of error expected from this type of voting machine, or the 1.5 percent expected from that, some had the temerity to point out that in a country that defines itself as the world's greatest democracy, where elections are our very sacrament, we seem to just accept that voting machines will regularly miscount the vote, while every day hundreds of millions of ATM transactions take place with an overall zero percent rate of error.

What does this say about what really matters to Americans as a nation?
