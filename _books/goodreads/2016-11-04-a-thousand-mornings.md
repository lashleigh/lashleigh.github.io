I read this on the airplane on my way to attend the funeral of a dear man. Poetry seemed like the right thing at the time though I don't know if he cared for poetry or not. One thing I do know is that he and Mary Oliver were kindred spirits who never met, with a shared appreciation for the depth of beauty in this world when people slow down and notice it.

My three favorites in the book are "Good bye fox", "Three things to remember" and "Extending the airport runway" but it was lovely in its entirety.

<b>Three things to remember</b>

As long as you're dancing, you can
   break the rules.
Sometimes breaking the rules is just
   extending the rules.

Sometimes there are no rules.
