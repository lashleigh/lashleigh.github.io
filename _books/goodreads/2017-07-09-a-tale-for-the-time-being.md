This book was a *trip*. I felt like I was in Electricity Town and BC and the monastery, but beyond physical travel I felt like Ozeki was giving me a tour in how to be a storyteller. Doing more with perspective in a single story than I have ever experienced before. 

If any of my friends read this I would _love_ to talk to you about it. Even if you don't like it, if you read any of it, I'll even listen to your rants, it's just the kind of book that begs for people to compare notes and impressions.
