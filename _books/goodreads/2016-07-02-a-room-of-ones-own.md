I wish so much that this book had replaced one of the umpteen plays of shakespeare I had to read in school, or any of the other classics. It is so inspiring and beautiful. I felt like I learned as much about being a woman in the few hours it took to read it as I learned in the 29 years leading up to that point.

There is an audiobook version available from LibraVox that I've now listened to twice, it is a fantastic recording (and free).
