A short haunting read. This is a diary kept by a man living in Syria under ISIS, smuggled out to BBC reporters, and presented here as text interspersed with drawings.

It made me feel weird. Because I loved it, the story, the design, the paper it was printed on, but every couple pages I would remember that everything in it was real and so beyond conception it made me want to cry. What do you do when you finish a book like that?
