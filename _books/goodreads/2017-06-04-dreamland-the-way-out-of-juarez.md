As I read the book I was taking pictures of favorite quotes and saving them in my notes, but soon I had to stop because it was every damn page. I love how the author and the artist threaded together multiple story lines, differentiating the plots by the fonts, art, and even rhythm of the words.

This was an inspiring example of how to bite into a hugely complex system and resist the urge to offer part-solutions. And in fact to show the futility of trying to take and treat any one chunk outside of the context of the whole.

<blockquote>
“Small improvements could be made in this system. Decent wages paid by American companies in Juarez would lessen the violence and slow or end illegal immigration in that area, but this is impossible because the companies must compete with business in Asia. Legalizing drugs would destroy the cartel and end the cash flow into their hands of tens of billions of dollars a year, but this is impossible because American citizens would consume drugs without guilt. Opening government files would prevent future cooperation with killers, but this is impossible because of the need for national security.

And giving security documents to me is well nigh impossible, because this would jeopardize careers and pensions and family dreams.

Everything is impossible except the status quo.”

<blockquote>
“Here is how it works: first some incident, say twelve men buried carefully in the backyard of a condo in a decent neighborhood, catches one’s attention. Then one investigates and sees the incident as part of a larger problem. Then one sees the problem as really an issue. Then one sees the issue as really a question that demands a new policy. Then, one feels comfort. Problem/issue/policy/defined and question answered. This is the death of the mind that slaughters the intellect of the educated on the line. Sometimes this death comes before anything but little fragments have been examined and the mind dies wrapped around the notion of, say, the drug war. Or of illegal immigration. Or of trade as embodied in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Cures are suggested: just say no, hire more narcs, an open border, guest worker permits, vigils against violence, poetry readings, plays, magazine stories such as I have written, heralding new horrors to savor.

I’ve moved into some place beyond that. I am here to announce the obvious, the war. It rages all along the line, it kills thousands, it slaughters beneath notice and it will spill gore on my ground when my bones rest in the brown earth I love. Thirty or forty years from now, the American adventures into the bowels of the Middle East will be forgotten details of bumbling imperialism. But what took place in this patio, what is taking place all along the line will profoundly alter the future of the United States. The future is here, even though I can’t even catch a trace of the rotting bodies with their gaping, toothy mouths.”
