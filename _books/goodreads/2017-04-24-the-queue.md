I haven't read a book this fast since the last Harry Potter came out, I really couldn't put it down, even though I thought I probably should just to give myself time to absorb it properly. It's a look into a surreal (but all too familiar and real feeling) dystopian future inspired by the authors experience of growing up in Egypt.

If you do read the book there is a lovely interview with the woman who translated it to English that is a must read (but only after reading the book - it has tons of spoilers). It was fascinating to hear about the challenges she faced in translating specific Arabic phrases into something that would carry the same meaning in English. https://thenewinquiry.com/let-loose-your-tongue/
