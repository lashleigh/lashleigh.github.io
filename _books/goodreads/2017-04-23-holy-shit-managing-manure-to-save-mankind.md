Gene Logsdon is the long lost uncle I never had, I feel like we would have been friends given the change. His writing is clear and funny and extremely accessible. I grew up on a farm, so I may be biased, but I think that the books he writes could be read by anybody.

Even if you never intend to have animals and figure out how to optimize your property for nutrient retention, knowing that this is how farmers really think about the world is valuable. There are a lot of people who don't personally know a farmer anymore and I think that distance can become dangerous, when we don't have a personal connection to a way of life it can start to seem alien and weird. The farmers are our friends, most of them are incredibly smart, and incredibly dedicated to preserving biodiversity and a healthy environment. I think that people like Gene really helped bridge the gap between rural and urban.

One favorite quote from the book in talking about limits to growth:
P. 146 Invariably, at the root of every collapse was an agricultural mistake. Or perhaps more accurately, at the root of every decline was an agricultural advancement that did not admit to the laws of natural limitation, and so became an agricultural mistake.
