What a resource! Hopefully someday I'll actually have the space to revisit this book and put some of the advice to use. I still really enjoyed reading about the design elements of intentional forestry for food production and all of the notes on plants familiar and obscure. There are many new things I'll be on the lookout for at the farmers markets.
