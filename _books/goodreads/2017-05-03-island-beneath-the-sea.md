This novel put me in mind of Half of a Yellow Sun (one of my favorites). The two books share an incredible level of story crafting that weaves real and imagined characters together, giving the simultaneous experience of a personal story and an accurate history of an area or era.

I didn't know very much about Haiti and what I got from the story was often horrifying but also very inspiring. Ninety-nine point nine percent of the time I felt like I wasn't so much reading as falling into this story, the writing was that good. The odd off percentage were the moments where she used the word "lugubrious". I have never encountered that word so many times in one book, maybe it's just more common that I knew...
