Graphic Novel adaptation of a beloved story? Yes, please! And it does not disappoint. It's funny that one of the things I often site about preferring books to movies is that I like imaging my own faces for the characters. But one of the things I most loved about this graphic novel was seeing someone else's faces for the monsters.
