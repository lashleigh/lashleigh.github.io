This is perhaps the weirdest book I've ever read. Some parts I really loved, the ending I straight up hated, and yet I keep thinking about it. The skill required to write such a story is something I can appreciate in and of itself, and I'll check out other things by Ozick.

This book comes in a few almost stand alone sections and one of the middle ones has a Russian woman, Lidia, who is one of my favorite characters from any book. There is this great moment where Lidia winds up at a gathering of liberals in New York who are preaching about the glory and possibility of communism and she puts them down so hard. It was beautiful.
