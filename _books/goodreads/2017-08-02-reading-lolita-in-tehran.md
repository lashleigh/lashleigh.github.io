I actually listened to the audiobook version and it was really well done. This book caught some criticism for not having more Persian authors, it instead centers a great many western classics (Austen, Bronte, Fitzgerald, etc).  I'm not really a fan of those classics, so I didn't expect to like this book much. What I found though was that the story of the authors life and her students, friends, and family were fascinating.

As for why she covers so few Persian works (and there are some) she speaks to that in the book a bit. As a professor during a time of great turmoil, and with students who were claiming the entire west was full of sick people, she felt it important to help them understand the west better.

There is huge insight to be gained here about revolution and radicalization, highly recommend.
