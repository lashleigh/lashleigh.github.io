I listened to the audiobook version and I think because of that I made it all the way through to the end. Or it's possible that audio wasn't a good way to experience this book and I would have liked it more on paper. While I can certainly appreciate that the author is a master story teller, and pieces of this book really hooked me, overall it wasn't a story I looked forward to continuing.
