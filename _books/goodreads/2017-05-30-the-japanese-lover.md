I admit that having read only one other book by Allende I had expected this one to be similar to her other, Island Beneath the Sea, and was a bit disappointed when it wasn't. Island Beneath the Sea was a big, sweeping, violent showcase of historical fiction. Whereas The Japanese Lover felt like... a love story, like a romance novel, like something that I would basically never decide to read. But I stuck with it and what I found was a really good story, not at all diminished by being smaller and more intimate.
