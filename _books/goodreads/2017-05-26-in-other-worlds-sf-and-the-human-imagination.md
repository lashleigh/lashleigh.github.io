This is a mix of short stories and essays, a few of them read by Atwood herself. 

There were many little gems, but overall not something I'd recommend to people beyond those who are already her fans.

Favorite quotes:
In talking about the tendency of technologists to make things worse and then propose more technical solutions: "They are not the people that should be deciding our future. Asking these kind of scientists what should be improved upon is like asking ants what you should have in your back yard: of course they would say more ants!"

The whole "Cold Blooded" short story. I want very much to see that delivered as a monologue by theatre groups everywhere.
