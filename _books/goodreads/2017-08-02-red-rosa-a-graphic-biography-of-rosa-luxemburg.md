This is amazing!!! Kate Evans is wildly talented and you should buy all of her books (she was also nice to me on twitter once, but that isn't why I'm saying this).

The graphic biography format is just something that I like, I know that I like it, so I wasn't really surprised to like this one too, but I also think it is one of the best of that genre I've ever seen. So if you aren't sure if graphic biographies are something you'd be into this is a good one to try out.

I'm not saying I agree with all of Luxemburg's politics, but they were (still are) revolutionary, she had a vision and a way for organizing that is very inspiring and I'm looking forward to finding out more.
