This was a great young adult story, I'm absolutely going to check out more from this author and recommend to the young people in my life. Or to the adults who enjoy shorter, quicker reads with a touch of fantasy. I loved how diverse the cast of characters was and how the author discussed the challenges that the less conforming characters faced.
