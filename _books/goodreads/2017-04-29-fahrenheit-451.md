This is one of those classics that I thought I probably should have read and finally did. I can see the context of what was so ground breaking, but it was also so dated. Reading older "important" books, especially those by prominent while male authors can just be so cringe-y, the superficiality of the women and the lack of color just kept being jarring the whole time.
