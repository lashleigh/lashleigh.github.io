I'm still getting used to Margaret Atwood and have only read a few things by her. So far the most dissonant part of reading her works is the surprising amount of sexism or (what seems to me) to be excessively gender stereotyped characters. The lead female in this story for example had a pretty underwhelming character development and was mostly on screen as a sex object.

That said, it was an interesting story and I did read it through to the end, but I don't know if I'll continue the series.
