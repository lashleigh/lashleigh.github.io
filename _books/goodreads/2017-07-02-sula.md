The slow work of moving to a less discriminatory world gets me down sometimes, and then I feel bad about feeling down because I know I have no reason to feel *really bad* since my life is objectively great. There is this odd guilt loop that can infect perfectly healthy people and make them ineffectual, and I've felt it trying to get a grip on me.

So it was in this mood that I read Sula, and received from the story a treasure trove of insight into how to remain calm in the face of all the bullshit (something women of color have become very good at). This book really spoke to me, about the shape and fragility of friendships, and about the importance of keeping all evils in perspective.

"Because each had discovered years before that they were neither white nor male, and that all freedom and Triumph was forbidden to them, they had set about creating something else to be."

<blockquote>
"What was taken by outsiders to be slackness, slovenliness or generosity was in fact a full recognition of the legitmacy of forces other than good ones. They did not believe doctors could heal -- for them, none had ever done so. They did not believe death was accidental -- life might be, but death was deliberate . . . . The purpose of evil was to survive it and they determined (without ever knowing they had made up their minds to do it) to survive floods, white people, tuberculosis, famine and ignorance. They knew anger well but not despair, and they didn't stone sinners for the same reason they didn't commit suicide -- it was beneath them."
