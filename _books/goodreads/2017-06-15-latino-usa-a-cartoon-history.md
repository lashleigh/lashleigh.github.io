I'm such a sucker for historical graphic novels, so was very predisposed toward liking this. And I did like it, but I also am very much a novice of Latin American culture so can't attest to the accuracy here. I appreciated that the author used the cast of characters to present opposing viewpoints and seemed to be making a genuine effort at being un-biased. Or rather, at admitting that everyone is biased, and then presenting many of the biases in the various speakers.

My primary nit was the tendency toward presenting history as a string of battles and Great Men (something the author himself made fun of). I would have liked to see more women mentioned. In the older history when sexism prevented women almost entirely from having a public voice I can make allowances, but in the parts of the book which focused on more recent history it seemed strange not to see more women.
