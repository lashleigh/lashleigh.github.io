This was fascinating, really helpful for teaching your brain to zoom out and see the big picture. 

The story that stuck with me was one she tells about a man who is making malaria nets. Suppose that he is running a small business with 5 employees and each person there has 15 dependents that they are providing for. This means that the net business is the livelihood of 90 people. Meanwhile in the USA it gets big in the news that people in Africa are dying from Malaria so some US celebrity decides to donate money for the construction of 100,000 malaria nets and send them to Africa. These nets are given for free, they flood the market and the small net business is now bankrupt. The 90 people are in a worse state than before. Additionally when the 100k nets inevitably wear out (average net life is 5 years) there will be no business that can replace them. The village is more dependent than ever on aid and if no celebrity comes forward with more nets in 5 years they will be sicker as well.

This is one of the problems with Aid. People give without seeing the whole picture and all too often Africans are represented by white western celebrities. A better way forward would have been for someone to offer to buy the nets from the African business making them and distribute them within the country for free, support and develop the local economy instead of snuffing it out.

Sometimes my eyes glazed over a bit at the paragraphs of dollar values (and this from someone who studied math and physics) but it was necessary. If you start the book and find those sections tiresome just keep going, I promise it is worth it.
