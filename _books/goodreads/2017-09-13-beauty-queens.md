This was hilarious, I actually laughed out loud. A lot. If you are a feminist, have been annoyed at society, and can enjoy poking fun at yourself and others, I can almost guarantee you'll have fun with this one.

The author wrote an excellent piece about the proposed Lord of the flies (but with women!) remake and that's how I learned about this book, article here -> http://ew.com/books/2017/09/01/the-diviners-author-libba-bray-has-some-thoughts-on-this-all-female-lord-of-the-flies-remake/
