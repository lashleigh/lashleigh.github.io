If you're curious about Occupy Wall Street, what the heck those people hoped to accomplish, and where their ideas were coming from this is a great book to pick up. I found a lot of inspiration in the pages and (as is typical of David Graeber) several newly pointed out problems to avoid.

One of my favorite sections in the book closely resembles <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2011/11/2011112872835904508.html">this</a> piece if you want to get a taste.

On Marxism and other socialist reforms:
<blockquote>
Even back in the 19th century, anarchists argued that this was a pipe dream. One cannot, they argued, create peace by training for war, equality by creating top-down chains of command, or, for that matter, human happiness by becoming grim joyless revolutionaries who sacrifice all personal self-realisation or self-fulfillment to the cause.

It's not just that the ends do not justify the means (though they don't), you will never achieve the ends at all unless the means are themselves a model for the world you wish to create.
</blockquote>

That rang very true to me, that the means themselves must be a model for the world we with to create.
