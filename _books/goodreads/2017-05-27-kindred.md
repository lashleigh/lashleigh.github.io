This was good and weird, I think it's more geared toward a young adult though.

This was my first Octavia Butler book and people around me have been talking her up to high heaven, so I may have gone in with excessively high expectations. I enjoyed it, but there was something a little bit jarring about her style that I can't quite put my finger on. I also went in to this book having come off of a book with some of the best writing I have ever read anywhere, so just about anything might have felt jarring after that.

I will definitely be seeking out more books by Octavia Butler. This one didn't make me a huge fan, but it was interesting and I'm looking forward to discovering more things from her.
