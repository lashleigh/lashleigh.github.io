Sorry, my review is not at all helpful -> here <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/95456142?book_show_action=true&from_review_page=1">read this one instead</a>.

Not the kind of story I normally like, it's a pop culture shit show kind of. The story centers on the music industry, douchey guys taking advantage of obnoxious girls, drugs, more dicks, and eventually their friends, children, etc. And yet it was a page turner, and it was interesting, and there were snippets that I really enjoyed.
