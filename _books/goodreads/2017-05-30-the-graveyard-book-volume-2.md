It was even more striking in the graphic novel presentation how different the two halves are. Honestly, I preferred the first half, but I hope that's something I'll grow out of. It's probably unhealthy to prefer the first half of ones life, the half that is always already done with and history, to the half that is full of uncertainty, opportunity, and the future.
