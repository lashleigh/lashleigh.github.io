I revisit "This is Water" often and love talking to other people who have read David Foster Wallace's cruise ship piece. I wasn't sure about a book <i>about</i> him though, that seemed like it might be weird, but I had many hours of flights ahead of me, so I was downloading every even slightly interesting looking audiobook from the library to prepare.

And this was really interesting, not the parts where they talked about movies and sports, but the parts where they talked about the future of literature, technology, and the human condition. I could hear a lot of the ideas that would eventually become "This is Water" in the initial forms here.

If you aren't already a fan of Wallace this would probably just be weird, if you are it delivers a lot of his wit and weirdness.
