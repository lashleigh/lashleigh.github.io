When I started listening to this audiobook (which he read himself) I was kind of doing it out of inertia. Out of a love for my childhood kooky hero. I'm already a scientist and not at all religious, so I wasn't surprised by anything he was presenting, and I was just about to turn it off since I wasn't really getting anything out of the book, when he dropped a real whopper of a statement: RACE ISN'T REAL.

Say what now? I backed up the audiobook to listen more closely. Ah, right, because this is a book that will cover only the "facts" he is talking about the biological trait of race. But I found it very unsettling, because race is of course very real to a great many people. And I couldn't help thinking how potentially harmful it could be for impressionable tech solutionist types to pick up this book and read the declaration "race isn't real" from their childhood hero.

It honestly makes me sad to realize that someone I very much looked up to is not a good role model. The utter lack of social understanding displayed in his books, the insistence that the scientific facts are the only facts that matter, it's unhealthy and worrying.
