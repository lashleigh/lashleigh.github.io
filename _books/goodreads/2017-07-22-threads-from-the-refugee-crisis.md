Kate Evans is brilliant (I'm just going to keep saying this). I shared a few images from Threads on <a href="https://twitter.com/lashleigh/status/893961252023742465">twitter</a> previously.

The visual investigative journalist is a powerful thing, she isn't just reporting on abstract data, this is stories from her first hand experience trying to help refugees and it is really powerful.
