Five stars for the title essay alone, it was hilarious and sad and true.

One very favorite quote from the title essay is prompted by a sponsored essay in the luxury cruise liner brochure. Wallace points out that:
“An ad that pretends to be art is -- at absolute best -- like somebody who smiles warmly at you only because he wants something from you. This is dishonest, but what's sinister is the cumulative effect that such dishonesty has on us: since it offers a perfect facsimile or simulacrum of goodwill without goodwill's real spirit, it messes with our heads and eventually starts upping our defenses even in cases of genuine smiles and real art and true goodwill. It makes us feel confused and lonely and impotent and angry and scared. It causes despair.”

I've continued to think about that quote. The essay was written in ~1996, so it is at least 20 years old now, and when I think about 20 years ago I feel like the world had way *less* advertising than we have in our lives now. Especially advertising of the disingenuous, don't-look-too-close, hey I'm not an ad I'm a brand presence and this is art, kind of ad.
