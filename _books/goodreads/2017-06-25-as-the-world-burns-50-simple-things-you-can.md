Yessss. Buy this for all your friends who tend toward sadness when things are going well for them, sadness because they know that things aren't going well for most of the world, most especially the environment, and they feel guilty they aren't doing more to help. Guilty, and angry, and pissed off, and maybe a little mad. This book won't make them feel better, but for a short time they will laugh and fell understood by at least one other person.
