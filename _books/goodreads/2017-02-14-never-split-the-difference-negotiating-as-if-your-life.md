I enjoyed listening to the audiobook version, I'm writing this review many months too late, but my memory is that the narration was good. 

The old advice that I saw for the first time while reading this book was the wisdom to "Never be so sure of what you want that you wouldn't take something better". I'd heard that phrased different ways but it really sunk in for the first time.

My other favorite quote: "People operating with incomplete information appear crazy to those who have different information"
