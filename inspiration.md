   * There is a MOOC by the same name, and the books by Barbara Oakley (creator of the MOOC) are also excellent.
 * The New Arrivals shelf at the public library
 * social media (friends, authors, and publishers on goodreads & twitter & instagram)
 * [The complete review](http://www.complete-review.com/main/main.html)
