Reading Inspiration
 * [Brain Pickings](https://www.brainpickings.org/)
 * Learing How to Learn weekly email
   * There is a MOOC by the same name (truth be told I didn't finish it) but I liked some of Barbara Oakley's books and the weekly newsletter is brief and interesting.
 * The New Arrivals shelf at the public library (also "librarian picks" tables at the library)
 * social media (friends and authors on goodreads & twitter & instagram)
 ** https://twitter.com/Read_Women
 ** https://twitter.com/lashleigh/lists/authors/members
 ** https://twitter.com/lashleigh/lists/books/members
 ** A google search will probably turn up better curated lists of authors and people who talk about books.
 * Publisher email newletters
 ** [Chelsea Green](http://www.chelseagreen.com/) - the politics and practice of sustainable living
 ** [Tor.com](https://www.tor.com/) - Science fiction, fantasy, the universe, and related subjects
 * [The complete review](http://www.complete-review.com/main/main.html)
 * [Overdrive podcast](http://overdrive.libsyn.com)
   * I confess I usually skip the podcast and jump straight to the transcript "list of books mentioned" section.

Other things I've stumbled up but haven't used yet
 * Wikipedia categories, for example [novels by US state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Novels_set_in_the_United_States_by_state) or [novels by country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Novels_by_country)
