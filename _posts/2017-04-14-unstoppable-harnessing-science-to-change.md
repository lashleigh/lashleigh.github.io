Holy cow y'all, my childhood hero Bill Nye writes books for adults now! And he read the audiobook version himself and he sounds exactly the same, it was such a treat to listen to.<br/><br/>I highly recommend pairing this book with This Changes Everything by Naomi Klein, I read them back to back and the contrasts are valuable. Bill Nye is a tech geek and I could so relate to a lot of what he got excited about, but having just read Klein's book I found his absolute faith in technical solutions to be a tad overly optimistic and his never mentioning the racist roots of which areas get saddled with the most environmental degradation to be a big miss. Like many engineers he focuses entirely on the technical problem and ignores the equally interesting complex problem of the social forces that are shaping how we value things. Different books and different authors are going to have different specialities though, which is why I most recommend the two books together. I think that Klein was perhaps too dismissive of our technical solutions and too untrusting of the ability of engineers to empathize and build smart things that actually won't make the world a worse place.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed hearing Nye's perspectives on the many bad and a few good ideas about big technical possibilities for how to help our warming planet.
