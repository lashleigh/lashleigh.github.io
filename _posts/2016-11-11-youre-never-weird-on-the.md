Fantastic memoir. Felicia Day has had a broad range of life experiences and she speaks (I listened to the audiobook) so honestly about them. There are parts where she continues to be overly hard on herself or critical of small things (we get it, you were home schooled) but I found them to be charming, it really felt like her voice came through in the book, as opposed to books that feel overly edited to remove some of these edges.<br/><br/>I especially appreciated her chapter on gamergate because I still hadn't really understood what that was about.
