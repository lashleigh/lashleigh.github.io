"Manage the work, not the people"<br/><br/>It seems so obvious, but when I was made a managers I had all kinds of concerns about how to 'motivate and empower people'. Further reading has shown me that all motivation that matters is intrinsic anyway; so all you can really do is create an autonomy supportive environment with clear metrics for success, provide encouragement, and maintain that environment. Then let people get on with their work. Any confusion still going on in my brain about what it meant to be a manager was cleared up with those 6 words.<br/><br/>I wasn't very fond of the style of the book (tedious use of dictionary definitions for one thing), but it is a quick read, and there are some gems.
