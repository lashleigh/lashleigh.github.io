I really enjoyed listing to Amy Schumer read the audiobook version of this, I think author read audiobooks are absolutely the way to go when comedians write about themselves. I knew from a little prior exposure that her brand of humor isn't my favorite but I was curious about the person behind the never ending vagina jokes and she doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>The world is extremely harsh toward women, especially women who are trying to make something of themselves in a male dominated field, especially especially when said women give zero fucks about what everybody else thinks of them and they aren't endlessly kind and pretty. When she talked about the pressure of having to "speak for all women" with every little thing she did I could relate. That pressure is real and it sucks. I'm glad that she is out there being herself and I hope that more of the world will warm up to the idea that women can come is just as many diverse packages as men, and that a woman doing her thing is not trying to redefine what women are, she is just trying to be herself.<br/>
