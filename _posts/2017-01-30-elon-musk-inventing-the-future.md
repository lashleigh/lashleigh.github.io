What was good:<br/> * Deep dive into the growth and histories of Tesla, SpaceX, and Solar City (I don't read hackernews, geekwire, etc, so it was fun to binge catch up on this).<br/> * A new perspective on the challenges of being an engineer. Compared to people living in hand built shelters trying to launch a rocket I really couldn't decide between relief and jealously.<br/><br/>What I hoped to get out of the book was some insight into what it takes to make a business with an environmental or human focus. Musk's stated personal purpose is to help move the human race to a multi-planetary species, and to remove our dependence on fossil fuels. Two things that I fully support (though would emphasize in the opposite order).<br/><br/>What I really got was a lot of amusing (sometimes tiresome) hero worship of Musk, interspersed with interesting company history, and a few great quotes. I grow weary of the "he's a jerk but he gets results" persona in tech culture, but at the same time I did come away from the book with an appreciation for many of Musk's perspectives. As a former physicist I can appreciate his approach to solving problems from first principals, but as an empathetic human being I think he (and the tech culture at large) need to expand what we care about to include social issues that are harder to quantify and derive.<br/><br/>Fun quotes:<br/>"If the rules are such that you can't make progress then you have to fight the rules."<br/>"I don't think we're doing a good job as a society deciding what things are really important to do"<br/>"The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads. That sucks."
