There are a lot of interesting ideas, but the parts I really liked are accessible in books like "Thinking Fast and Slow" without requiring me to pay attention to (what felt like) endless pages of baseball stats. If you happen to really like baseball, gambling, politics, and statistics you will probably really enjoy this book.
