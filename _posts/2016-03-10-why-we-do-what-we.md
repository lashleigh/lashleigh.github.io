There were so many helpful insights in this book, but a few that really stood out for me were:<br/>* a better understanding of how to build autonomy supportive environments (not permissive ones). And what it means to actually support autonomy, Deci's whole take on the dynamics of one-up/one-down relationships was illuminating.<br/>* the importance of reflecting on one's own reactivity. I had never seen reactivity described as a manifestation of ego-involvement before. <br/><br/>On the dangers of getting what you ask for. This reminded me of the classic "do rewards work? Sure! They motivate people to get rewards".<br/><blockquote><br/>They needed the numbers, so they directed their creativity and resourcefulness toward getting those numbers, rather than toward effective performance.<br/></blockquote>  <br/><br/>This reminded me of the dangers of ad-hoc planning in a growing company:<br/><blockquote><br/>Social contexts that are extremely inconsistent and chaotic, that make it impossible for them to figure out what is expected of them and how to behave competently so as to achieve intrinsic or extrinsic outcomes, will lead to a thwarting of the human spirit. It will leave people with little or no motivation.<br/></blockquote>
