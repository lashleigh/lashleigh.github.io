I had been thinking about reading this book for months, the description sounded interesting and yet, the title was so.... braggy? Something about it was vaguely off putting, plus the book is huge, and I am often a flake when it comes to huge books. They remind me of assigned readings in school and I promised myself a few years ago that I didn't have to read things I thought I "should" read, I could go ahead and only read the things that I actually wanted to. So I had to check it out from the library twice before I actually started reading it, but THEN hot damn I couldn't put it down.<br/><br/>There is so much information packed in here, it's a bit of an acronym plunge at times, but so good. I confess that when the audiobook became available from the library I switched to listening while I worked in the garden and found the pairing of climate science research with pulling up hundreds of pounds of English Ivy to be most satisfactory.<br/><br/>Some take aways:<br/> * We can't consume our way to a more sustainable future, producing and buying too much disposable shit is what got us into our current problems. This can be summarized in a tweet: https://twitter.com/amy_vetter/status/845000165538889733<br/> * So many examples large and small of environmental destabilization that isn't getting the media attention it really probably should<br/> * Some people really hated on her analogy about the earth having a miscarriage (read the book, it makes sense in context), but I loved it.<br/> * Respect for indigenous people and supporting their rights to the land could be what saves the land for all of us
