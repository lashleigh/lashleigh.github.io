This was an opportunistic book, it had been set at a display angle in the library and caught my eye, and I figured "why not?". My reading is heavily non-fiction these days, and I figured a lifetime network meets buzzfeed style millennial memoir would be a fun way to shake things up.<br/><br/>Parts of this book were annoying, there were dozens of pages of email exchanges, the contents of which were generally boring banter about soup or sex. These parts I skimmed. There were other parts that were really insightful though, so insightful that I thought maybe they were an accident, or maybe the author is a legit genius. The story about the spider and boundaries made me laugh out loud. <br/><br/>Overall I can't think of a single person I would recommend this to, and yet I don't regret having read it. It was a pleasant way to spend an evening of reading, but it lacked substance and aside from the spider story there isn't much I remember only a few days later. This book doesn't ask much of the reader, it doesn't ask you to think or to empathize or to interpret, which is usually what I want from my stories.
