Well researched and easy to read. I didn't agree with all of the authors conclusions, but I appreciated the way that he presented them - as in "here are some ideas and suggestions", rather than "here is the absolute solution and anything else is stupid".<br/><br/>Highly recommend to people who are interested in knowing more about the food system and how we can go about getting fresh healthy food for all people in the country.
