This book was uncomfortable to read, and I guess that's why I'm glad that I read it. Parts of it made Bronnie Ware sound like an extreme crazy hippie, but I also felt like everything she shared was true. It was sweet and felt like a real persons genuine attempt to share what they know, and definitely not like something that was heavily edited and packaged to be a big hit with the public.
