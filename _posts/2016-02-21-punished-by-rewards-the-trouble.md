This book blew my mind. If you've ever wanted to get someone to do something, definitely give this a read before the next time you try.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>With respect to the workplace or public policy, we talk casually about the use of "carrots and sticks", and there is food for thought here too. Before these words came to be used as generic representations of bribes and threats, what actually stood between the carrot and the stick was, of course, a jackass.<br/>p.24<br/></blockquote>
