I became a huge fan of Carol Deppe after happening across a copy of "Breed Your Own Vegetable Varieties" - why I picked that book up off the library shelf I can't really say, vegetable breeding was not something I was looking to do at the time. In The Tao she delivers more great advice about how to grow food, but more precious (and a reason why folks who don't even plan to garden may want to give this a read) are her anecdotes about life, history, and the role of food production in civilizations.
