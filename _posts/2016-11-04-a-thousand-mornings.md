I read this on the airplane on my way to attend the funeral of a dear man. Poetry seemed like the right thing at the time though I don't know if he cared for poetry or not. One thing I do know is that he and Mary Oliver were kindred spirits who never met, with a shared appreciation for the depth of beauty in this world when people slow down and notice it.<br/><br/>My three favorites in the book are "Good bye fox", "Three things to remember" and "Extending the airport runway" but it was lovely in its entirety.<br/><br/><pre><br/><b>Three things to remember</b><br/><br/>As long as you're dancing, you can<br/>   break the rules.<br/>Sometimes breaking the rules is just<br/>   extending the rules.<br/><br/>Sometimes there are no rules.<br/></pre><br/>
