A few great things:<br/> * Challenged me to look at corporate philanthropy in a very different light. <br/> * Scratched the surface of WTF is going on in Kashmir<br/> * "Do we need weapons to fight wars? Or do we need wars to create a market for weapons?"<br/><br/>This was an interesting short book; kind of a rough starting point for somebody who doesn't have a strong grasp of India (geography, history, or even little things like pronouncing names), but I did enjoy it and will be seeking out more by the author. I'm kind of embarrassed about the struggle with names, it's something I'm going to work on correcting, but keeping track of who is who in another language was harder than I expected.<br/><br/>
