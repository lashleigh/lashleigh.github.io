I love how the author and the artist threaded together multiple story lines, differentiating the plots by the fonts, art, and even rhythm of the words.<br/><br/>This was an inspiring example of how to bite into a hugely complex system and resist the urge to offer part-solutions. And in fact to show the futility of trying to take and treat any one chunk outside of the context of the whole.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>“Small improvements could be made in this system. Decent wages paid by American companies in Juarez would lessen the violence and slow or end illegal immigration in that area, but this is impossible because the companies must compete with business in Asia. Legalizing drugs would destroy the cartel and end the cash flow into their hands of tens of billions of dollars a year, but this is impossible because American citizens would consume drugs without guilt. Opening government files would prevent future cooperation with killers, but this is impossible because of the need for national security.<br/><br/>And giving security documents to me is well nigh impossible, because this would jeopardize careers and pensions and family dreams.<br/><br/>Everything is impossible except the status quo.”<br/></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>“Here is how it works: first some incident, say twelve men buried carefully in the backyard of a condo in a decent neighborhood, catches one’s attention. Then one investigates and sees the incident as part of a larger problem. Then one sees the problem as really an issue. Then one sees the issue as really a question that demands a new policy. Then, one feels comfort. Problem/issue/policy/defined and question answered. This is the death of the mind that slaughters the intellect of the educated on the line. Sometimes this death comes before anything but little fragments have been examined and the mind dies wrapped around the notion of, say, the drug war. Or of illegal immigration. Or of trade as embodied in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Cures are suggested: just say no, hire more narcs, an open border, guest worker permits, vigils against violence, poetry readings, plays, magazine stories such as I have written, heralding new horrors to savor.<br/><br/>I’ve moved into some place beyond that. I am here to announce the obvious, the war. It rages all along the line, it kills thousands, it slaughters beneath notice and it will spill gore on my ground when my bones rest in the brown earth I love. Thirty or forty years from now, the American adventures into the bowels of the Middle East will be forgotten details of bumbling imperialism. But what took place in this patio, what is taking place all along the line will profoundly alter the future of the United States. The future is here, even though I can’t even catch a trace of the rotting bodies with their gaping, toothy mouths.” <br/></blockquote>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Wallace points out that:<br/>“An ad that pretends to be art is -- at absolute best -- like somebody who smiles warmly at you only because he wants something from you. This is dishonest, but what's sinister is the cumulative effect that such dishonesty has on us: since it offers a perfect facsimile or simulacrum of goodwill without goodwill's real spirit, it messes with our heads and eventually starts upping our defenses even in cases of genuine smiles and real art and true goodwill. It makes us feel confused and lonely and impotent and angry and scared. It causes despair.”<br/><br/>I've continued to think about that quote. The essay was written in ~1996, so it is at least 20 years old now, and when I think about 20 years ago I feel like the world had way *less* advertising than we have in our lives now.

Bill Nye is a tech geek and I could so relate to a lot of what he got excited about, but having just read Klein's book I found his absolute faith in technical solutions to be a tad overly optimistic and his never mentioning the racist roots of which areas get saddled with the most environmental degradation to be a big miss. Like many engineers he focuses entirely on the technical problem and ignores the equally interesting complex problem of the social forces that are shaping how we value things. Different books and different authors are going to have different specialities though, which is why I most recommend the two books together.

Compared to people living in hand built shelters trying to launch a rocket I really couldn't decide between relief and jealously.<br/><br/>What I hoped to get out of the book was some insight into what it takes to make a business with an environmental or human focus. Musk's stated personal purpose is to help move the human race to a multi-planetary species, and to remove our dependence on fossil fuels. Two things that I fully support (though would emphasize in the opposite order).<br/><br/>What I really got was a lot of amusing (sometimes tiresome) hero worship of Musk, interspersed with interesting company history, and a few great quotes. I grow weary of the ""he's a jerk but he gets results"" persona in tech culture, but at the same time I did come away from the book with an appreciation for many of Musk's perspectives. As a former physicist I can appreciate his approach to solving problems from first principals, but as an empathetic human being I think he (and the tech culture at large) need to expand what we care about to include social issues that are harder to quantify and derive.<br/><br/>Fun quotes:<br/>""If the rules are such that you can't make progress then you have to fight the rules.""<br/>""I don't think we're doing a good job as a society deciding what things are really important to do""<br/>""The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads.

The importance of setting boundaries with our technology, not letting it become a distraction machine, giving our real life relationships precedent, are all things I completely agree with and I enjoyed seeing someones else's take on explaining why. <br/><br/>Rushkoff's thoughts also included historical details that I had not considered from previous tech revolutions (language, written word, printing press, broadcast media). The idea that the masses have always ended up at the mercy of an elite few: ""...while Renaissance kings maintained their monopoly over the printing presses by force, today's elite is depending on little more than our own disinterest."" Rushkoff thinks the few who will have undue sway now are the technologists and so it behooves everyone to learn something of programming. <br/><br/>What I didn't agree with was an argument he made about how being a programmer makes it easier to see how the systems of the world exist and influence each other. I know plenty of people who can't code that are extremely well versed in complex systems and plenty of programmers who still don't understand systemic racism.<br/><br/>Fun quotes:<br/> * Like the participants of media revolutions before our own, we have embraced the new technologies and literacies of our age without actually learning how they work and work on us.<br/> * Digital reduction yields maps. These maps are great for charting a course, but they are not capable of providing the journey. No matter how detailed or interactive the map gets, it cannot replace the territory.<br/> * We learn to socialize and make friends through interfaces and networks that may be more dedicated to finding a valid advertising model than helping us find one another.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Suppose that he is running a small business with 5 employees and each person there has 15 dependents that they are providing for. This means that the net business is the livelihood of 90 people. Meanwhile in the USA it gets big in the news that people in Africa are dying from Malaria so some US celebrity decides to donate money for the construction of 100,000 malaria nets and send them to Africa. These nets are given for free, they flood the market and the small net business is now bankrupt. The 90 people are in a worse state than before. Additionally when the 100k nets inevitably wear out (average net life is 5 years) there will be no business that can replace them. The village is more dependent than ever on aid and if no celebrity comes forward with more nets in 5 years they will be sicker as well.<br/><br/>This is one of the problems with Aid. People give without seeing the whole picture and all too often Africans are represented by white western celebrities. A better way forward would have been for someone to offer to buy the nets from the African business making them and distribute them within the country for free, support and develop the local economy instead of snuffing it out.<br/><br/>Sometimes my eyes glazed over a bit at the paragraphs of dollar values (and this from someone who studied math and physics) but it was necessary.
